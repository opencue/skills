# just

Reference for `just`, the command runner. Use when working in a project with a `justfile` or when the user mentions `just` or `justfile`.

> Source: canonical / upstream community skill. Local additions live in `meta/workspace-recipes` (the `~/Documents/Justfile`).

## Discovery

- `just --dump` — Print justfile
- `just --evaluate` — Print variable values
- `just --help` — Print detailed command-line syntax help
- `just --list` — Print recipes with descriptions
- `just --show <RECIPE>` — Print recipe source
- `just --summary` — Print recipes without descriptions

## Execution

- `just` — Run default recipe
- `just <RECIPE>` — Run specific recipe
- `just <RECIPE> <ARG1> <ARG2>` — Run recipe with arguments

## Syntax

```just
executable := 'main'

# compile main.c
compile:
  cc main.c -o {{ executable }}

# run main
run: compile
  ./{{ executable }}

# run test
test name: compile
  ./bin/test {{ name }}

# start webserver
serve port='8080':
  python -m http.server {{port}}

# publish current tag
publish:
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  set -euxo pipefail
  tag=`git describe --tags --exact-match`
  ./bin/check-tag $tag
  git push origin $tag
```

## Notes

- The comment preceding a recipe is used as its doc-comment, and included in `just --list`.
- By default, each line of a recipe runs in a fresh shell. Recipes whose bodies start with `#!` are written to a file and executed as a script.
- Commonly used commands and scripts should be turned into just recipes.
